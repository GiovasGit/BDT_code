Make sure Redis and its most common modules are properly installed. In particular, ReJSON is needed when results are
retrieved from Redis. Please check the README file into the 'redis_setup' folder. Moreover, before running any code it's
best to start Redis by sending "redis-server /etc/sysctl.conf" into CLI.
